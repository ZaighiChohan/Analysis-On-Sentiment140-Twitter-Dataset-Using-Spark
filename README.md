# Big Data Project – Twitter Communication Detection Using Text Classification

This project implements a large-scale **text classification pipeline** using **Apache Spark** and **Databricks** to identify communication types (e.g., hashtag, mention, direct message) from Twitter data. It demonstrates core principles of Big Data processing, feature engineering, and machine learning at scale.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Built using **Databricks** (Spark)
- Real-world **Twitter dataset** for sentiment & communication detection
- Applied **TF-IDF**, feature hashing, and logistic regression
- Visualized performance metrics and communication patterns
